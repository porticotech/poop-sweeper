 * A reducer is a function that takes inputs of state + an action

 * use on an array reduce:
 * 
 *  const sumReducer = (total, num) => total + num;
 *  const sum = [3, 4, 5].reduce(sumReducer);   // 12
 *
 * However instead of it acting on an array it is happening on our state 
 * over time depending on what action we have done
 * 
 * @func
 * @param {Map} state The state of the game
 * @param {Object} action An action to execute on the state
 * @return {Map} A new version of the state once the action has been applied
